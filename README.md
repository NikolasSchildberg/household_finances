# Household Finances

## What is it

Two-in-one:
- Cute little basics of python data science libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib), and
- Applying those to exploring household finances

There's not much for now. Hope I can improve it every once in a while.

## How to use it

- Replace mock data (csv) files by your own budget data.
- If you want to use data in not the exact format, change parameters accordingly.
- Run __main.py__ (or the other scripts separetedly) and go explore your finances.
